Hello readers,

 # This repository contains programs for some common Computer Based Numerical and Statistical Techniques.
 
 ### The programs, here are divided into three categories(directories) which are:-
  
 1. Algebraic and Transcendental Equations,
 2. Interpolation, &
 3. Numerical Methods for calculating Differentiation and Integration.
 
 The Programs(Methods) in each category are as:-
 
 1.  -------------------------------Algebraic and Transcendental Equations----------------------------
 
       a). Bisection Method.    
       b). Regula Falsi Method.      
       c). Newton Raphson Method.
      
      
  2. -----------------------------Interpolation----------------------------------
    
    a). Equal Intervals
    
               i. Newton's Gregory Forward Intepolation Formula.
              ii. Newton's Gregory Backward Interpolation Formula.
             iii. Strirling's Interpolation Fromula.
        
     b). Unequal Intervals
           
                i. Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation Formula.
               ii. Lagrange's Interpolation Formula.
